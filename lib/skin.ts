/**
 * Skins — the whole palette, the typeface pairing and the corner radii, as
 * data, so one template can wear more than one look.
 *
 * `app/globals.css` still holds the token *structure*: which custom
 * properties exist, how Tailwind maps them, and the Hearthline values as the
 * built-in fallback. What this file does is let a deployment swap every one
 * of those values at once. `app/layout.tsx` reads `activeSkin` and emits the
 * chosen skin's tokens into the document head, light and dark together.
 *
 * That is the same idea Mobile Home Manager uses to dress one codebase as
 * many dealerships. The difference is that this is a static template, so the
 * skin is picked at build time in this file rather than per request from a
 * database.
 *
 * To add a skin: copy a block below, change the values, add its id to
 * `SkinId`, and point `activeSkin` at it. To restyle a single deployment
 * without adding a skin, edit `:root` and `.dark` in `app/globals.css` — the
 * skin only overrides what it names, so both approaches work.
 *
 * Typefaces are the one thing that cannot be fully data-driven: `next/font`
 * has to see its calls literally to self-host the files at build time. So the
 * families are loaded in `app/layout.tsx` and a skin picks between them by
 * name here.
