/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  THE LAND-DEALS PRICING. Every number on `/land-deals` comes from this file —
 *  the map, the county list, the detail card and the social preview image.
 *
 *  This is *market* data, in the sense of `lib/market.ts`: it is true of one
 *  dealership's delivery radius and of nowhere else. What ships here is the
 *  North Florida market drawn from Gainesville. Selling into another market
 *  means replacing these counties, moving `HQ` in `./geo.ts`, and regenerating
 *  the boundaries — see `scripts/generate-county-shapes.py`. Do not leave one
 *  market's counties on another market's site.
 *
 *  ON THIS DEPLOYMENT THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THE PAGE IS OFF. Country Homes of
 *  New Mexico sells out of Albuquerque and publishes no county-by-county land
 *  pricing at all, so `landDeals` is `false` in `lib/page-config.ts` and the
 *  route redirects to `/`. Everything below is still Florida. Before turning
 *  the page on: move `HQ` to 11500 Central Ave SE, regenerate the county
 *  shapes for Bernalillo, Sandoval, Valencia, Santa Fe and Torrance, and get
 *  real starting payments and lot-price ranges from the business. Do not
 *  estimate them.
 *
 *  `startingPayment`  estimated monthly payment on a land + home package, i.e.
 *                     the cheapest realistic way into that county today.
 *  `land`             what a buildable lot actually trades for in that county.
 *  `lotTypical`       the parcel size those numbers assume.
 *
 *  Payment estimates assume one loan covering land and home, 20% down, ~20–23
 *  year term, on approved credit. Update `PAYMENT_ASSUMPTIONS` below whenever
 *  rates or programs move, and keep the disclaimer honest.

 * band. Because they are custom properties they are applied through `style`
