 *
 * Country Homes of New Mexico sells homes onto the buyer's own ground —
 * "we turn your land into home sweet home" is the headline — and it names
 * no manufactured-home community it places into or has an arrangement
 * with. Listing one anyway would be a claim about somebody else's property
 * as well as about this business, so there is nothing here and
 * `communities` is switched off in `lib/page-config.ts` to match.
 *
 * If the dealership does start placing homes into named communities, add
 * them here from the operator's own pages, fill in only the figures those
 * pages publish, point each listing's `communitySlug` at one, and turn the
 * page back on. Lot rents, homesite counts and vacancy change constantly:
 * an absent figure hides itself, an out-of-date one gets quoted at you.
