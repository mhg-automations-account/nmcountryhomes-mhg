/**
 * The privacy policy and the terms.
 *
 * These two are the only pages on the site with no switch in
 * `lib/page-config.ts`: a site that collects a name and a phone number needs
 * to say what it does with them, and that is not a section a deployment gets
 * to turn off.
 *
 * What is here is a starting draft written against what this template
 * actually does — it takes enquiries through a form, forwards them to a
 * webhook, and stores saved homes in the visitor's own browser. It is not
 * legal advice and it has not been reviewed by anyone qualified to give any.
 * Before a real site goes live, have a lawyer in your state read both, and
 * amend the clauses about data sharing, retention and dispute resolution to
 * match what the business genuinely does.
 *
 * `{name}`, `{email}`, `{phone}` and `{state}` are substituted from
 * `lib/site.ts` at render time; a clause whose placeholder has no value is
 * dropped rather than printed with a hole in it.
