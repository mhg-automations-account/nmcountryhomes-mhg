/**
 * Which sections the landing page renders, and which pages exist at all.
 *
 * The template used to hard-wire both: every deployment got the same eleven
 * bands down the home page and exactly the routes that happened to be in
 * `app/`. That is fine for one site and wrong for a dealership that has no
 * team to introduce, no promotion running, and no blog it will ever write.
 *
 * So the landing page is now a list of sections rendered in a fixed order,
 * each behind a switch, and the optional pages are a second list of switches.
 * A section turned off is not rendered. A page turned off redirects to `/`
 * rather than 404ing, so a stale link — a Google Business Profile, a printed
 * card, an old ad — still lands somewhere useful.
 *
 * The order below is the order the sections appear in. Changing a `true` to
 * a `false` is the supported way to shorten the page; deleting the section
 * from `components/landing.tsx` is not, because the next deployment wants it
 * back.
 *
 * Two of the sections are data-gated as well as switched: `meetTeam` needs
 * `company.team` to hold somebody, and `videoShowcase` needs `videoShowcase`
 * below to hold a URL. A switch turned on with nothing behind it stays
 * hidden — same rule as everywhere else in this template. An absent fact is
 * a shorter page, never an invented one.
