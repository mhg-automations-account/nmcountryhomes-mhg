# Country Homes of New Mexico — where things live

This is the manufactured-home dealership site for Country Homes of New
Mexico, 11500 Central Ave SE, Albuquerque, built on the Hearthline template.
Almost every change is a data change; routes derive from the data and should
rarely be edited directly.

```
lib/homes.ts        The catalogue. Prices, specs, copy, features, scenes.
lib/floor-plans.ts  Room geometry in feet. Rooms must tile the footprint.
lib/communities.ts  Communities, tenure, lot rents, amenities.
lib/photos.ts       Every photograph on the site, by key. Absent key =
                    an empty plate; the site shows photographs only.
lib/site.ts         Business name, phone, address, canonical URL.
lib/page-config.ts  Which bands the landing page renders, in what order,
                    and which routes exist at all. Turning a page off
                    redirects it to `/` and removes its links everywhere.
                    Also the two pieces of phone chrome: `callBar`, the
                    strip above the header, and `floatingCall`.
lib/navigation.ts   Header, drawer and footer links, filtered through
                    page-config. Add a route here, not as a stray anchor.
lib/faq.ts          The questions. `/faq` shows all of them, the foot of
                    `/why-manufactured` shows the first six.
lib/promotions.ts   Live offers, each with an end date. Ships empty.
lib/blog.ts         Posts. Ships empty; `/blog` is switched off to match.
lib/custom-pages.ts Campaign pages at `/p/<slug>` — the landing page
                    narrowed to one series. Ships empty.
lib/legal.ts        Privacy and terms clauses. A draft to be reviewed by
                    a lawyer, not legal advice.
lib/company.ts      What the business claims about itself — founding year,
                    staff, principles, warranty, deposit terms. Every field
                    optional; an absent one hides its section rather than
                    being guessed at.
lib/market.ts       Facts true of this market only — counties, wind and
                    thermal zone, state titling, USDA notes. Also optional;
                    the copy falls back to a portable sentence.
lib/land/           Everything behind /land-deals: `areas.ts` prices each
                    county in the delivery radius, `geo.ts` holds the lot's
                    coordinates and the projection, and the generated file
                    holds the county boundaries. Market data in the sense
                    above — true of one radius and of no other. STILL THE
                    TEMPLATE'S NORTH FLORIDA DATA, and `landDeals` is off in
                    `lib/page-config.ts` because of it: this dealership
                    publishes no county-by-county land pricing. Rewrite these
                    for the Albuquerque radius before turning the page on.
lib/skin.ts         Skins: the whole palette, the brand gradient, the
                    typeface pairing, the corner radii and the primary
                    button, as data. Three ship — `hearthline` (warm and
                    editorial, a serif on limestone), `nerto` (white ground,
                    slate type, a blue-to-orange gradient on every primary
                    button, system sans — the look a Mobile Home Manager
                    deployment wears) and `country`, which is `nerto`
                    wearing this dealership's own sage and olive, taken from
                    its live site rather than guessed at. `activeSkin` picks
                    one — it is `country` — and that one line restyles the
                    site.
app/globals.css     Token structure and the fallback values. A skin
                    overrides whatever it names; edit here to restyle one
                    deployment without adding a skin.
components/landing.tsx
                    The landing page, as an ordered list of switchable
                    bands. `/` and every `/p/<slug>` render it — edit the
                    band here and both follow. It ships in the short,
                    conversion-shaped order: hero, offer, one wide
                    photograph, reviews, three steps, the catalogue, the
                    closing call and form, the hours. Eight more bands are
                    written, styled and switched off — among them the whole
                    editorial argument for a manufactured home (`ticker`,
                    `numbers`, `myth`, `cutaway`) — each one `true` away.
```

The catalogue is at `/listings`; `/homes` permanently redirects there. The
data file is still `lib/homes.ts` — the route was renamed, the file was not.

It holds the ninety homes on the lot, read from the dealership's own
inventory site at manufacturedcountryhomes.com. `scripts/nmch-catalogue.json`
is the scrape, `scripts/nmch-selection.json` says which gallery image fills
which scene, and `scripts/import-nmch.mjs` rebuilds the photography
(`sheets`, `singles`, `photos`) and the manufacturer plan drawings
(`plans`) from them. Node's fetch does not read `HTTPS_PROXY` on its own, so
run it as `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 node scripts/import-nmch.mjs …`. Thirty-nine
of the ninety have no photographs at the source; those listings declare no
scenes and their galleries render as the empty plate, which is correct.
Prices are the published price BEFORE OPTIONS — the home, not delivery, set
or site work.

Homes are browsed by size first — tiny, single, double, triple. The bucket
comes from `sections` where the home has one, never from square footage
alone, because "single wide" is a claim about width and filing a 1,000 sq ft
double-section home under it would be false. Buckets with no homes in them
are not rendered.

Detailed conventions and recipes are in `.claude/skills/` — `homes`,
`photos`, `brand`, `voice` and `land-deals`. Read the matching one before
editing; it is the contract for these files. `EDITING.md` is the same ground
for the human asking.

Never invent a fact about the business. If a dealership does not publish
its founding year, its staff or its warranty terms, delete the field in
`lib/company.ts` — the page shortens itself. `npm run check:placeholders`
(part of `npm run lint`) lists the template's fictional values still in
place, and fails outright once `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is a real domain.

Roughly 5,000 words of editorial copy in `components/landing.tsx`,
`lib/faq.ts` and on `/why-manufactured`, `/start-here`, `/land-deals` and
`/financing` are the template's own writing, and every deployment ships them identically. That is fine for one site and a problem
for the second one sold into the same market. `npm run check:boilerplate`
scores how much is still verbatim; the `voice` skill does the rewrite, which
keeps a locked list of facts intact.

Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before reporting a change done.
