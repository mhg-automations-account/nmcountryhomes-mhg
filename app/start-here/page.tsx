      <p>
        Yes — most buyers do not own land when they start. You lease a homesite in a
        community and own the home on it, which is the fastest and cheapest way in. The
        trade is that the home is usually titled as personal property, so it depreciates,
        and the lot rent is set by the community owner. If you would rather build equity,
        the other two routes above are worth pricing before you commit.

        On land you own, with a permanent foundation and a real-property title:

        eligible homes at or near site-built rates. On a leased pad it is a chattel loan

      <p>
        Homes on owned land, on a permanent foundation, titled as real property, behave
        like houses. Homes on a rented pad, titled as personal property, generally behave
        like vehicles. That is a land and titling question rather than a construction
        question — the home itself is identical either way — and it is the single most
        important thing to understand before you sign anything.

        A HUD-code home built to a specification that lets it appraise against site-built
        houses: permanent foundation, a porch, drywall throughout, higher roof pitch. It
        is the category that closes the gap between manufactured and site-built lending.

        From a signed order, a plant build slot is typically a few weeks and the set
        itself is a couple of days. The part that takes real time is the ground: a
        community application can clear in a week, while a parcel that needs a septic
        permit and a power run can take a season. Start there and the rest follows
        quickly.

    title: "Can I move the home later?",

        needs permits and a transport company, and older homes do not always survive the
        trip well. Plan the home where it is going to stay, and treat the ability to move
        it as an emergency option rather than a feature.

                <p>
                  A manufactured home leaves the plant with a certificate of origin, much
                  like a vehicle. On a leased pad it usually stays that way — titled as
                  personal property, financed with a chattel loan, taxed and insured
                  accordingly, and depreciating on paper no matter how well it is built.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Set the identical home on land you own, on a permanent foundation, and
                  retire that title into the real estate, and it becomes a house in the
                  eyes of a lender, an appraiser and the county. Longer term, lower rate,
                  and it moves with the housing market instead of against it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Neither is wrong. Leasing a pad gets people into a home years earlier
                  than saving for a parcel would. But it should be a decision you made,
                  not one that happened to you at a closing table.
