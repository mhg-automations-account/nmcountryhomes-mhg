/**
 * The landing page, as an ordered list of bands.
 *
 * Two routes render this: `/` and every custom page under `/p/<slug>`. A
 * custom page is the same landing narrowed to one series — the same hero, the
 * same closing call to action, a listings band showing only that slice of the
 * catalogue — which is why the whole composition lives in one component
 * instead of being written twice and drifting.
 *
 * Order is the array in `BANDS` below, and it is the only place the order
 * lives. Whether a band appears at all is `lib/page-config.ts`; whether it
 * *can* appear is the data behind it. Both have to say yes.
 *
 * The numbered eyebrows are counted after the switches are applied, so a site
 * with four bands turned off still reads 01, 02, 03 down the page rather than
 * 01, 04, 07.

                      Most people who buy a manufactured home do not own an acre to put it

                      in a community, buy a lot, or put land and home together on one loan
                      &mdash; and which of those you pick changes the monthly payment more
                      than any option you will ever tick on a plan.
