/**
 * The four buckets a buyer shops by — tiny, single, double, triple — as a row
 * of big obvious buttons. This is the primary way into the catalogue on both
 * the landing page and `/listings`.
 *
 * A bucket with nothing in it is not rendered. A lot with no triple-wides
 * shows three buttons, not four with one that leads to an empty page — the
 * same rule the rest of the template follows about not advertising what is
 * not there. The footprint under each label is measured from the homes
 * actually in that bucket, so it cannot disagree with the catalogue.
 *
 * Two modes. Given `active`/`onSelect` it behaves as a filter control; given
 * neither it renders links to `/listings?size=<id>`, which is what the
 * landing page wants.
