# Editing this site by prompt

Everything on this site is data in a handful of files, so most changes are a
sentence rather than a task. Open Claude Code in this repo and ask. The
conventions are written down in `.claude/skills/`, so any session — this one
or one six months from now — already knows where things live before you
explain anything.

Five skills load automatically:

| Skill | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `homes` | listings, prices, specs, copy, floor plans |
| `photos` | every picture on the site |
| `brand` | company details, colours, fonts, page copy, forms, which pages and homepage bands exist |
| `land-deals` | the county price map on `/land-deals` |
| `voice` | rewriting the editorial copy so two sites do not read alike |

You never have to name one. Say what you want changed and the matching skill
picks itself up. Typing `/homes`, `/photos`, `/brand`, `/land-deals` or
`/voice` forces one.

## The look

Three whole looks ship in `lib/skin.ts` and one line switches between them.
This site wears `country` — the sage and olive off its own live site, on a
white ground. `hearthline` is warm and editorial; `nerto` is the same shape
as `country` in blue and orange. Ask for one by name, or ask for a new one.

> Switch the site to the Direct skin.

> Make a skin like the Direct one but with our green as the primary and a
> serif for headlines.

> The buttons should be square, not pills.

## Pages and homepage bands

The homepage is a list of bands and the site is a list of pages, and both are
switches in `lib/page-config.ts`. Turning one off is a supported edit: the
band stops rendering, or the route redirects to `/` and disappears from the
header, the drawer, the footer and the sitemap together.

> We have no team to show. Drop the "meet the team" band from the homepage.

> Turn the blog on — here is the first post.

> Put a spring promotion on the site: $4,000 off any TRU home through 30
> April, and say so in the banner under the hero.

> Move the testimonials above the homes on the front page.

> We do not want a blog, a build-a-home wizard or an offers page. Take all
> three off.

> Add a campaign page at /p/crossmod for the CrossMod homes — same front
> page, just those homes in the listings band.

## Homes

> Drop The Alder to $179,900 and show the old price struck through.

> Mark The Juniper as sale pending.

> Add a new home: The Sitka, Cottage series, model CT-1648, $142,500, 2 bed
> 1 bath, 768 sq ft, single-section 16 × 48, coastal style, at Harbor Light.
> Write the tagline and story to match the voice of the others.

> The Alder's primary bedroom should be 15 × 17, not 17 × 17 — fix the floor
> plan and any copy that quotes the old number.

> Retire The Cedar. Remove it from the catalogue.

> Every Estate home should list a three-car detached garage option under
> features.

## Pictures

Put the image files anywhere in the repo — or drag them into the chat — and
say where they go.

> Here are six photos of The Alder. Wire them up as its gallery: exterior,
> living, kitchen, bedroom, bath, porch.

> Replace the homepage hero photo with this one and rewrite the alt text.

> Use this photo for Cedar Hollow on the communities page.

> Put a real photo behind the financing page header.

The site shows photographs and nothing else. Photographs can arrive one at a
time: anything without one holds its space with an empty plate saying a
photograph is to come, so nothing is ever pictured that does not exist.

## Land and home prices

`/land-deals` is a map of every county you deliver to, each shaded and
labelled with what it takes to get into a home there on land the buyer owns.
Every figure on it comes from `lib/land/areas.ts`.

> Marion County is $1,499 a month now, and lots there are running $35k to
> $70k.

> Drop Volusia — we don't deliver that far any more.

> Add Alachua's neighbour Putnam back at $1,340 with 1/4 to 1 acre lots.

> Rates moved. Re-estimate every county at 25% down and update the
> assumptions line under the map to match.

> We're not in Florida — we're in Maryville, Tennessee. Redraw the map for
> the counties we actually deliver to, and here are our numbers for each.

That last one is the big one: the map ships with one dealership's market on
it, and a map centred on a town you do not trade from is worse than no map.
Expect a session to move the lot's coordinates, replace the counties and
regenerate the boundaries from the census data, and to ask you for prices
rather than inventing them.

> Send the pre-approval form to our CRM.

The pre-approval form is already wired to a Server Action: set
`LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL` and every lead is posted to it as JSON. Until then leads
are logged to the server console rather than dropped.

## Brand and copy

> We're now Cascade Modular Homes, (541) 555-0199, 200 Industrial Way, Bend
> OR 97702. Change it everywhere.

> Make the accent colour a deep teal instead of the orange, in both light and
> dark themes.

> Rewrite the homepage hero headline and subhead to lead with the 11-week
> build time.

> Send the enquiry form to our HubSpot endpoint instead of resolving locally.

## Before it goes live

The template shipped as Hearthline Home Co. — an invented dealership, with an
invented founder, an invented set crew and invented warranty terms. All of
that has been replaced with what Country Homes of New Mexico actually
publishes about itself, and everything it does not publish was deleted rather
than carried over: there is no founding year, no homes-sold figure, no dealer
licence number, no warranty term, no transport radius and no deposit
schedule on this site, because the business has not put any of them in
public. If it starts to, add them; do not invent them to fill the layout.

Everything of that kind lives in `lib/company.ts`, and every field in it is
optional. Whatever you can fill in from what the business already says about
itself, fill in. Everything else, delete — the page hides the section rather
than leaving a stranger's version of it. A dealership that publishes nothing
about its staff simply has no team section, and the About page renumbers
itself and reads fine.

> Here's the client's current site. Pull across whatever they say about
> themselves — years in business, staff, what's included in the price — and
> delete anything in `lib/company.ts` they don't publish.

> We don't offer a structural warranty. Take that claim off the site.

> Drop the team section — they don't want staff named.

Run `npm run check:placeholders` to confirm nothing of the fiction survives.
It currently reports clean. It passes while you are working locally and fails
the build once `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` points at a real domain, so a site
cannot go out with the fiction back on it.

One thing on `/land-deals` belongs in this list too: the counties, the
payments and the lot prices on that map are one dealership's market. They are
not placeholders you can leave in — see the section above. On this site the
page is switched off in `lib/page-config.ts` and `lib/land/` still holds the
template's North Florida numbers. Rewrite them for the Albuquerque radius
before you turn it back on.

What does *not* need *correcting*: the HUD Code history, the chattel-versus-
mortgage numbers, the titling explanation and the buyer's order of operations
on `/why-manufactured`, `/financing` and `/start-here`. Those are true of
manufactured housing in any market. Making them read like this dealership
rather than like the template is a separate job — next section.

## Selling it more than once

Around 4,800 words on `/`, `/why-manufactured`, `/start-here`,
`/land-deals` and `/financing` are the template's own writing, and they ship identically every
time. For the first site that is invisible. For the second one in the same
market it is a real problem: a competitor reads the same paragraphs, a buyer
comparing two tabs sees them, and Google picks one site to rank for that copy
and quietly discounts the other.

```bash
npm run check:boilerplate   # how much is still the template's words
```

A fresh clone reports 100%. Under 25% is a properly rewritten site.

> Rewrite the editorial copy in this client's voice — here are three pages
> from their current site. Keep the argument and the locked facts.

> Fill in `lib/market.ts` for Pierce County, Washington and work the local
> specifics into the financing and start-here copy.

> These two clients are both in Tampa. Make sure their sites don't share
> paragraphs.

The rules for that pass — which facts may never move, which beats must
survive, what a good rewrite looks like versus a thesaurus pass — are in the
`voice` skill, and a session picks it up on its own from a request like the
ones above. The short version: the HUD Code dates and the chattel rate gap
are checkable facts and must survive in substance; the argument's structure
is the template's actual value and must survive too; the sentences carrying
them are what gets rewritten. Filling in `lib/market.ts` is the cheapest real
differentiation, because a page that knows the buyer's wind zone and their
state's titling rule is both unique and more useful than the generic one.

## Bigger asks

> Add a "Land & site work" page explaining what buyers pay for beyond the
> home, in the same voice as the financing page, and link it from the nav.

> The comparison table on /why-manufactured is out of date — update the
> site-built column and say what you changed.

## What to expect back

A session should run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before telling you it
is done, and say plainly if either failed. If you want to see the change,
`npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000.

If a request is ambiguous in a way that changes the outcome — which of two
homes, whether a price drop should show a strikethrough — expect a question
rather than a guess.
